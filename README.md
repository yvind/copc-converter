[![docs.rs](https://docs.rs/copc_converter/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/copc_converter)

A fast, memory-efficient converter that turns LAS/LAZ point cloud files into [COPC](https://copc.io/) (Cloud-Optimized Point Cloud) files.

## Features

- Produces spec-compliant COPC 1.0 files (LAS 1.4, point format 6, 7, or 8 — automatically chosen from input)
- Merges multiple input files into a single COPC output
- Out-of-core processing with a configurable memory budget — handles datasets larger than RAM
- Parallel reading, octree construction, and LAZ compression via rayon
- Preserves WKT and GeoTIFF CRS from input files (GeoTIFF EPSG codes are translated to WKT for the output)
- Preserves LAS Extra Bytes (per-point user-defined attributes such as classification probabilities, intensity ratios, or producer-specific labels) end-to-end, with per-file min/max stats merged honestly into the output VLR
- Optional temporal index for GPS-time-based filtering ([spec](https://github.com/360-geo/copc/blob/master/copc-temporal/docs/temporal-index-spec.md))

## Installation

Requires Rust 1.85+.

### From crates.io

```sh
cargo install copc_converter
```

### From source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/360-geo/copc-converter.git
cd copc-converter
cargo install --path .
```

This installs the `copc_converter` binary to `~/.cargo/bin/`, which should be on your `PATH`.

### Pre-built binaries

Download pre-built binaries from the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/360-geo/copc-converter/releases) page. These are built for broad compatibility and run on any machine.

For best performance, prefer installing from source via `cargo install` — this automatically compiles with `target-cpu=native`, optimizing for your specific CPU's instruction set (AVX2, NEON, etc.).

## Usage

```sh
# Single file
copc_converter input.laz output.copc.laz

# Directory of LAZ/LAS files
copc_converter ./tiles/ merged.copc.laz
```

| `--memory-limit` | Max memory budget (`16G`, `4096M`, etc.) | auto-detected |
| `--threads` | Max parallel threads | all cores |
| `--temp-dir` | Directory for intermediate files | system temp |
| `--temporal-index` | Write a temporal index EVLR for time-based queries | off |
| `--temporal-stride` | Sampling stride for the temporal index (every n-th point) | `1000` |
| `--progress` | Progress output format: `bar`, `plain`, or `json` | `bar` |
| `--temp-compression` | Compress scratch temp files: `none` or `lz4` | `none` |
| `--node-storage` | Per-node temp layout: `files` or `packed` | `files` |

#### Temp file compression and node storage layout

Large conversions create a lot of scratch data. Two independent knobs
shape the temp directory's footprint:

- **`--temp-compression`** controls the on-disk encoding of each batch of
  `RawPoint` records. `none` (default) writes raw bytes; `lz4` wraps each
  batch in a self-contained LZ4 frame. LZ4 compresses at >1 GB/s per core
  so CPU cost is modest, and on network filesystems (EFS/NFS) it often
  reduces wall time because the bottleneck shifts from I/O to compute.
- **`--node-storage`** controls the filesystem layout of per-node point
  data during build. `files` (default) writes a separate file per octree
  node; on very large inputs node counts reach the hundred-thousands,
  which can exhaust inode budgets on shared scratch filesystems.
  `packed` writes all node data into a handful of append-only pack files
  (one per worker thread) with an in-memory key→offset index,
  independent of node count.

Both flags can be combined freely.

**Measured on a 168M-point / 701 MB LAZ input, 32 GB budget:**

| `--node-storage` | `--temp-compression` | wall  | peak inodes | peak temp bytes | output   |
|------------------|----------------------|-------|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| files            | none                 | 61.7s | 6 716       | 12 161 MB       | 1028 MB  |
| files            | lz4                  | 71.3s | 6 716       |  5 848 MB       | 1028 MB  |
| packed           | none                 | 66.7s | 76          | 11 894 MB       | 1028 MB  |
| packed           | lz4                  | 73.8s | 76          |  5 849 MB       | 1028 MB  |

LZ4 cuts peak temp bytes by ~52% regardless of storage mode; packed cuts
peak inodes by ~99% regardless of compression. Output is byte-identical
across all four combinations (within hash-order noise of a few KB). Dead
space from pack-file overwrites was not observable on this workload.

Use `packed` when the scratch filesystem has an inode limit, `lz4` when
it is space-constrained, and both together for the most disk-friendly
run on a modest wall-time budget.

### Examples

```sh
copc_converter ./my_survey/ survey.copc.laz --memory-limit 8G

# With temporal index (useful for multi-pass mobile mapping data)
copc_converter ./my_survey/ survey.copc.laz --temporal-index
```

## Library usage

The crate exposes a typestate pipeline API that enforces correct step ordering at compile time:

```rust
use copc_converter::{
    NodeStorage, Pipeline, PipelineConfig, TempCompression, collect_input_files,
};

let files = collect_input_files("./tiles/".into())?;
let config = PipelineConfig {
    memory_budget: 12_884_901_888,
    temp_dir: None,
    temporal_index: false,
    temporal_stride: 1000,
    progress: None, // or Some(Arc::new(your_observer))
    chunk_target_override: None,
    temp_compression: TempCompression::None,
    node_storage: NodeStorage::Files,
};

Pipeline::scan(&files, config)?
    .validate()?
    .distribute()?
    .build()?
    .write("output.copc.laz")?;
```

## Tools

Optional analysis tools are available behind the `tools` feature:

```sh
cargo build --release --features tools
```

### inspect_copc

Inspect a COPC file's structure, or compare two files side-by-side. Works with local files and HTTP URLs.

```sh
# Inspect a single file
inspect_copc pointcloud.copc.laz

# Compare two files
inspect_copc pointcloud.copc.laz --compare other.copc.laz
```

Prints node counts, point distribution, compressed sizes, and compression ratios per octree level. When the file has a temporal index EVLR, also prints GPS time range, per-level temporal coverage, a time histogram, and sample density stats.

### preview_chunking

Preview how an input LAS/LAZ dataset would be partitioned during conversion, without actually writing anything:

```sh
preview_chunking input.laz [--memory-limit 16G] [--chunk-target 5M]
```

Prints chunk count, target size, grid resolution, and per-chunk size distribution. Useful for tuning `--memory-limit` before running a long conversion.

## How it works

1. **Scan** — reads headers from all input files in parallel to determine bounds, point count, point format, CRS (WKT or GeoTIFF), and any LAS Extra Bytes schema.
2. **Validate** — checks that all input files share the same CRS, point format, and Extra Bytes schema, and selects the appropriate COPC output format (6, 7, or 8). Per-file Extra Bytes min/max stats are merged into a single canonical VLR at this stage.
3. **Count** — first full pass over the input: populates an occupancy grid used by the chunk planner to carve the dataset into thousands of roughly equal-sized chunks via counting sort.
4. **Distribute** — second full pass over the input: streams every point (including any trailing Extra Bytes) into its chunk's scratch file on disk, bounded by the configured memory budget.
5. **Build** — each chunk's sub-octree is built independently in memory in parallel, then merged at coarse levels up to a single global root, thinning points at each level to produce multi-resolution LODs.
6. **Write** — encodes and compresses nodes in parallel into a single COPC file with a hierarchy EVLR for spatial indexing.
