//! Hierarchical counting-sort chunk planner (Schütz et al. 2020).
//!
//! Determines what chunks the build path will produce for a given dataset.
//! Used by the main pipeline's distribute stage and exposed via the
//! `analyze` CLI subcommand for inspection without writing output.
//!
//! # Algorithm
//!
//! 1. **Count**: stream every input file in parallel, atomically incrementing
//!    a flat 3D counting grid at the chosen resolution (128³, 256³, or 512³).
//!    Each cell of the grid corresponds to an octree voxel at the same depth
//!    (`d_grid = log2(grid_size)`).
//!
//! 2. **Merge sparse cells**: walk the implicit pyramid from the finest level
//!    to the root. For each 2×2×2 group of children, if their combined point
//!    count fits within the chunk target size and none of the children are
//!    already "blocked", collapse the group into the parent cell. Otherwise
//!    each non-empty child becomes a chunk root and the parent is blocked.
//!
//! 3. **Result**: a [`ChunkPlan`] listing every chunk root as
//!    `(level, gx, gy, gz, point_count)`. Most chunks are at fine levels in
//!    dense regions and at coarse levels in sparse regions.
//!
//! # Memory bound
//!
//! Peak memory during the merge phase is roughly the size of two adjacent
//! pyramid levels: ~604 MB for a 512³ grid, ~75 MB for 256³, ~10 MB for 128³.
//! This is independent of the input dataset size.
