## [Unreleased]

## [0.9.15] - 2026-05-20

### Fixed

- Header-bounds mismatch warning no longer fires on float round-tripping noise.
  The tolerance is now 1.5 scale units per axis (was strictly > 1 scale unit),
  which absorbs the few-ULP overshoot from `int32 × scale + offset` reconstruction
  and the common case of LAS headers stored one decimal coarser than point
  precision. A warning now indicates a real ≥2-unit disagreement worth investigating.

## [0.9.14] - 2026-05-18

### Changed

- Bumped dependencies to clear 10 Dependabot alerts.

## [0.9.13] - 2026-05-18

### Added

- GeoTIFF CRS support. When a LAS file has no WKT CRS VLR but does carry GeoTIFF
  keys, the EPSG code is now translated to WKT via the `crs-definitions` registry
  and propagated into the COPC output. Cross-format mismatches between WKT and
  GeoTIFF inputs are caught via a best-effort trailing-EPSG parse. (#13)

## [0.9.12] - 2026-05-11

### Changed

- Extra Bytes validation now compares only the *structural* parts of the schema
  across input files (field count, types, scale/offset). Per-file min/max/no_data
  stats are allowed to differ and are merged honestly (union of mins, union of
  maxes) into the output VLR.

## [0.9.11] - 2026-05-11

### Fixed

- Exclude `tests/data/*` from the published crate tarball. Real-LAS test fixtures
  pushed the tarball over crates.io's 10 MiB limit. The library still builds and
  tests from git, just not from the published tarball.

## [0.9.10] - 2026-05-11

### Added

- LAS Extra Bytes pass-through. The `LASF_Spec/4` Extra Bytes VLR and every
  point's trailing extra bytes are now carried from input to output unchanged.
  Previously both were silently dropped, losing any classification or semantic
  data stored in extras (a common pattern for ML-labelled or research datasets).
  Validation enforces an identical VLR and uniform `num_extra_bytes` across
  inputs.
